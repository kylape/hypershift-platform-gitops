                          "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                          the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                          index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                          referencing a part of an object.

                                      messageExpression declares a CEL expression that evaluates to the validation failure message that is returned when this rule fails.
                                      Since messageExpression is used as a failure message, it must evaluate to a string.
                                      If both message and messageExpression are present on a rule, then messageExpression will be used if validation
                                      fails. If messageExpression results in a runtime error, the validation failure message is produced
                                      as if the messageExpression field were unset. If messageExpression evaluates to an empty string, a string with only spaces, or a string
                                      that contains line breaks, then the validation failure message will also be produced as if the messageExpression field were unset.
                                      messageExpression has access to all the same variables as the rule; the only difference is the return type.

                                    maxInFlight determines how many in flight remediations should happen at the same time.

                                    Remediation only happens on the MachineSet with the most current revision, while
                                    older MachineSets (usually present during rollout operations) aren't allowed to remediate.

                                    Note: In general (independent of remediations), unhealthy machines are always
                                    prioritized during scale down operations over healthy ones.

                                    MaxInFlight can be set to a fixed number or a percentage.
                                    Example: when this is set to 20%, the MachineSet controller deletes at most 20% of
                                    the desired replicas.

                                    If not set, remediation is limited to all machines (bounded by replicas)
                                    under the active MachineSet's management.

                                            messageExpression declares a CEL expression that evaluates to the validation failure message that is returned when this rule fails.
                                            Since messageExpression is used as a failure message, it must evaluate to a string.
                                            If both message and messageExpression are present on a rule, then messageExpression will be used if validation
                                            fails. If messageExpression results in a runtime error, the validation failure message is produced
                                            as if the messageExpression field were unset. If messageExpression evaluates to an empty string, a string with only spaces, or a string
                                            that contains line breaks, then the validation failure message will also be produced as if the messageExpression field were unset.
                                            messageExpression has access to all the same variables as the rule; the only difference is the return type.

                                        prioritized during scale down operations over healthy ones.

                                        MaxInFlight can be set to a fixed number or a percentage.

                                        maxUnavailable is the maximum number of machines that can be unavailable during the update.
                                        Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired
                                        machines (ex: 10%).
                                        Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding down.
                                        This can not be 0 if MaxSurge is 0.
                                        Defaults to 0.
                                        Example: when this is set to 30%, the old MachineSet can be scaled
                                        down to 70% of desired machines immediately when the rolling update
                                        starts. Once new machines are ready, old MachineSet can be scaled
                                        down further, followed by scaling up the new MachineSet, ensuring
                                        that the total number of machines available at all times
                                        during the update is at least 70% of desired machines.

                      remediation controls the strategy of remediating unhealthy machines
                      and how remediating operations should occur during the lifecycle of the dependant MachineSets.

                        description: |-
                          maxInFlight determines how many in flight remediations should happen at the same time.

                          Remediation only happens on the MachineSet with the most current revision, while
                          older MachineSets (usually present during rollout operations) aren't allowed to remediate.

                          Note: In general (independent of remediations), unhealthy machines are always
                          prioritized during scale down operations over healthy ones.

                          MaxInFlight can be set to a fixed number or a percentage.
                          Example: when this is set to 20%, the MachineSet controller deletes at most 20% of
                          the desired replicas.

                          If not set, remediation is limited to all machines (bounded by replicas)
                          under the active MachineSet's management.

                          maxSurge is the maximum number of machines that can be scheduled above the
                          desired number of machines.
                          Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of
                          desired machines (ex: 10%).
                          This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0.
                          Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up.
                          Defaults to 1.
                          Example: when this is set to 30%, the new MachineSet can be scaled
                          up immediately when the rolling update starts, such that the total
                          number of old and new machines do not exceed 130% of desired
                          machines. Once old machines have been killed, new MachineSet can
                          be scaled up further, ensuring that total number of machines running
                          at any time during the update is at most 130% of desired machines.

                          maxUnavailable is the maximum number of machines that can be unavailable during the update.

                          machines (ex: 10%).
                          Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding down.

                          starts. Once new machines are ready, old MachineSet can be scaled
                          down further, followed by scaling up the new MachineSet, ensuring
                          that the total number of machines available at all times
                          during the update is at least 70% of desired machines.

                          readinessGates specifies additional conditions to include when evaluating Machine Ready condition.

                          This field can be used e.g. by Cluster API control plane providers to extend the semantic of the
                          Ready condition for the Machine they control, like the kubeadm control provider adding ReadinessGates
                          for the APIServerPodHealthy, SchedulerPodHealthy conditions, etc.

                          Another example are external controllers, e.g. responsible to install special software/hardware on the Machines;
                          they can include the status of those components with a new condition and add this condition to ReadinessGates.

                          NOTE: This field is considered only for computing v1beta2 conditions.
                          NOTE: In case readinessGates conditions start with the APIServer, ControllerManager, Scheduler prefix, and all those

                          This helps to improve readability of conditions bubbling up to the Machine's owner resource / to the Cluster).

                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                          and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                          for the APIServerPodHealthy, SchedulerPodHealthy conditions, etc.

                          Another example are external controllers, e.g. responsible to install special software/hardware on the Machines;
                          they can include the status of those components with a new condition and add this condition to ReadinessGates.

                          NOTE: This field is considered only for computing v1beta2 conditions.

                  machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                  generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                  able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                  and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                  This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                  be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                  Another example are external controllers, e.g. responsible to install special software/hardware on the Machines;
                  they can include the status of those components with a new condition and add this condition to ReadinessGates.

                  * A new MachineSet is created and replicas should be managed by the autoscaler
                  * An existing MachineSet which initially wasn't controlled by the autoscaler

                          This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
                          with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
                          machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
                          generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
                          able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
                          and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
                          This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
                          be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

                          for the APIServerPodHealthy, SchedulerPodHealthy conditions, etc.

                          Another example are external controllers, e.g. responsible to install special software/hardware on the Machines;
                          they can include the status of those components with a new condition and add this condition to ReadinessGates.

                          NOTE: This field is considered only for computing v1beta2 conditions.

                  In the event that there is a terminal problem reconciling the

                  These fields should not be set for transitive errors that a
                  controller faces that are expected to be fixed automatically over
                  time (like service outages), but instead indicate that something is
                  fundamentally wrong with the MachineTemplate's spec or the configuration of
                  the machine controller, and that manual intervention is required. Examples
                  of terminal errors would be invalid combinations of settings in the
                  spec, values that are unsupported by the machine controller, or the
                  responsible machine controller itself being critically misconfigured.

                  Any transient errors that occur during the reconciliation of Machines
                  can be added as events to the MachineSet object and/or logged in the
                  controller's output.

                      ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects
                      users must create. This is a copy of customizable fields from metav1.ObjectMeta.

                      ObjectMeta is embedded in `Machine.Spec`, `MachineDeployment.Template` and `MachineSet.Template`,
                      which are not top-level Kubernetes objects. Given that metav1.ObjectMeta has lots of special cases
                      and read-only fields which end up in the generated CRD validation, having it as a subset simplifies
                      the API and some issues that can impact user experience.

                      During the [upgrade to controller-tools@v2](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/1054)
                      for v1alpha2, we noticed a failure would occur running Cluster API test suite against the new CRDs,
                      specifically `spec.metadata.creationTimestamp in body must be of type string: "null"`.
                      The investigation showed that `controller-tools@v2` behaves differently than its previous version
                      when handling types from [metav1](k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1) package.

                      In more details, we found that embedded (non-top level) types that embedded `metav1.ObjectMeta`
                      had validation properties, including for `creationTimestamp` (metav1.Time).
                      The `metav1.Time` type specifies a custom json marshaller that, when IsZero() is true, returns `null`
                      which breaks validation because the field isn't marked as nullable.

                      In future versions, controller-tools@v2 might allow overriding the type and validation for embedded
                      types. When that happens, this hack should be revisited.

                                        dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                        volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                        core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                        When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                        the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                        provisioner.
                                        This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                        if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                        compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                        value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                        When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                        There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                        * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                          allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                        * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                          preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                          specified.
                                        * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                          in any namespaces.
                                        (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                        (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

This may be any local object from a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner.
                                        This field will replace the functionality of the DataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, both fields (DataSource and DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                        There are two important differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef:
                                        * While DataSource only allows two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                        * While DataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.

                                  - "None": No action will be taken, according to the specified 'RunStrategy' the VirtualMachine will be restarted or shutdown.
                                  - "LiveMigrate": the VirtualMachineInstance will be migrated instead of being shutdown.
                                  - "LiveMigrateIfPossible": the same as "LiveMigrate" but only if the VirtualMachine is Live-Migratable, otherwise it will behave as "None".
                                  - "External": the VirtualMachineInstance will be protected and `vmi.Status.EvacuationNodeName` will be set on eviction. This is mainly useful for cluster-api-provider-kubevirt (capk) which needs a way for VMI's to be blocked from eviction, yet signal capk that eviction has been called on the VMI so the capk controller can handle tearing the VMI down.

                                        The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                        or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                        In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                        |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                        - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                        scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                        violate MaxSkew(1).
                                        - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                        When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                        to topologies that satisfy it.
                                        It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                        MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                        When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                        Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                        And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                        this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                        As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                        scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                        If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                        Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                        When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                        |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                        The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                        In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                        because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                        it will violate MaxSkew.

                                        TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
                                        and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
                                        We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                                        of pods into each bucket.
                                        We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                                        Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
                                        nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                                        e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.

                                        - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
                                        - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                                          but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                                          skew.
                                        A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                                        if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                                        "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same

                                        If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                                        to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies

                                                dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                                volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                                core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                                When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                                the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                                provisioner.
                                                This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                                if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                                compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                                value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                  specified.
                                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                  in any namespaces.
                                                (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                                (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

If the provisioner or an external controller can support the specified data source, it will create a new volume based on the contents of the specified data source.

                                                Specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty volume is desired. This may be any local object from a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner.
                                                This field will replace the functionality of the DataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, both fields (DataSource and DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                There are two important differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef:
                                                * While DataSource only allows two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                * While DataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                                (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                          - "None": No action will be taken, according to the specified 'RunStrategy' the VirtualMachine will be restarted or shutdown.
                                          - "LiveMigrate": the VirtualMachineInstance will be migrated instead of being shutdown.
                                          - "LiveMigrateIfPossible": the same as "LiveMigrate" but only if the VirtualMachine is Live-Migratable, otherwise it will behave as "None".
                                          - "External": the VirtualMachineInstance will be protected and `vmi.Status.EvacuationNodeName` will be set on eviction. This is mainly useful for cluster-api-provider-kubevirt (capk) which needs a way for VMI's to be blocked from eviction, yet signal capk that eviction has been called on the VMI so the capk controller can handle tearing the VMI down.

                                                MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                                When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                                between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                                The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                                or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                                labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                                In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                                | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |

                                                - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                                scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                                violate MaxSkew(1).
                                                - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                                When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                                to topologies that satisfy it.
                                                It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                                MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                                When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                                Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                                And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                                this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                                As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                                scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                                If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                                Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                                When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                                labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                                | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                                |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                                The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                                In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                                because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                                it will violate MaxSkew.

                                                and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
                                                We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                                                of pods into each bucket.
                                                We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                                                Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of

                  TransitionDelay configures how quickly the system reacts to clusters transitioning between size classes.
                  It may be advantageous, for instance, to have a near-instant scale-down for clusters that begin to
                  use fewer resources, but allow for some lag on scale-up to ensure that the use is sustained before
                  incurring the larger cost for scale-up.

          HostedCluster is the primary representation of a HyperShift cluster and encapsulates
          the control plane and common data plane configuration. Creating a HostedCluster
          results in a fully functional OpenShift control plane with no attached nodes.
          To support workloads (e.g. pods), a HostedCluster may have one or more associated
          NodePool resources.

                          requiredHSTSPolicies specifies HSTS policies that are required to be set on newly created  or updated routes
                          matching the domainPattern/s and namespaceSelector/s that are specified in the policy.
                          Each requiredHSTSPolicy must have at least a domainPattern and a maxAge to validate a route HSTS Policy route
                          annotation, and affect route admission.

                          A candidate route is checked for HSTS Policies if it has the HSTS Policy route annotation:
                          "haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header"
                          E.g. haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header: max-age=31536000;preload;includeSubDomains

                          - For each candidate route, if it matches a requiredHSTSPolicy domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector,
                          then the maxAge, preloadPolicy, and includeSubdomainsPolicy must be valid to be admitted.  Otherwise, the route
                          is rejected.
                          - The first match, by domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector, in the ordering of the RequiredHSTSPolicies
                          determines the route's admission status.
                          - If the candidate route doesn't match any requiredHSTSPolicy domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector,
                          then it may use any HSTS Policy annotation.

                          The HSTS policy configuration may be changed after routes have already been created. An update to a previously
                          admitted route may then fail if the updated route does not conform to the updated HSTS policy configuration.
                          However, changing the HSTS policy configuration will not cause a route that is already admitted to stop working.

                          Note that if there are no RequiredHSTSPolicies, any HSTS Policy annotation on the route is valid.

                                        Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                                        Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                                        tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                                        TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be
                                        of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                                        it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                                        negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                    description: |-
                      scheduler holds cluster-wide config information to run the Kubernetes Scheduler
                      and influence its placement decisions. The canonical name for this config is `cluster`.
                    properties:
                      defaultNodeSelector:
                        description: |-
                          defaultNodeSelector helps set the cluster-wide default node selector to
                          restrict pod placement to specific nodes. This is applied to the pods
                          created in all namespaces and creates an intersection with any existing
                          nodeSelectors already set on a pod, additionally constraining that pod's selector.
                          For example,
                          defaultNodeSelector: "type=user-node,region=east" would set nodeSelector
                          field in pod spec to "type=user-node,region=east" to all pods created
                          in all namespaces. Namespaces having project-wide node selectors won't be
                          impacted even if this field is set. This adds an annotation section to
                          the namespace.
                          For example, if a new namespace is created with
                          node-selector='type=user-node,region=east',
                          the annotation openshift.io/node-selector: type=user-node,region=east
                          gets added to the project. When the openshift.io/node-selector annotation
                          is set on the project the value is used in preference to the value we are setting
                          for defaultNodeSelector field.
                          For instance,
                          openshift.io/node-selector: "type=user-node,region=west" means
                          that the default of "type=user-node,region=east" set in defaultNodeSelector
                          would not be applied.

                          turned on, all the master nodes in the cluster will be made schedulable,
                          so that workload pods can run on them. The default value for this field is false,
                          meaning none of the master nodes are schedulable.
                          Important Note: Once the workload pods start running on the master nodes,
                          extreme care must be taken to ensure that cluster-critical control plane components
                          are not impacted.

                  It is useful when you need to apply patch management side like a CVE, transparently for the hosted cluster.

                  If defined, it will dicate the version of the components running management side, while spec.release will dictate the version of the components landing in the hosted cluster data plane.
                  If not defined, spec.release is used for both.
                  Changing this field will trigger a rollout of the control plane.
                  The behavior of the rollout will be driven by the ControllerAvailabilityPolicy and InfrastructureAvailabilityPolicy for PDBs and maxUnavailable and surce policies.

                          endpointPublishingStrategy is used to publish the default ingress controller endpoints.

                          The endpoint publishing strategy is determined by the following precedence order:
                          1. User-specified endpointPublishingStrategy (highest priority) - if this field is set,
                             it takes precedence over all other configuration methods
                          2. Platform-specific defaults with annotation overrides - if no user strategy is set,
                             the platform type determines the default strategy, which can be further modified by:
                             - hypershift.openshift.io/private-ingress-controller annotation (sets PrivateStrategyType)
                             - hypershift.openshift.io/ingress-controller-load-balancer-scope annotation (sets LoadBalancerScope)
                          3. Generic LoadBalancer fallback - if the platform is not recognized, defaults to
                             LoadBalancerService with External scope

                          Platform-specific defaults when endpointPublishingStrategy is not set:
                          - AWS: LoadBalancerService with External scope (or NLB if configured)
                          - Azure, GCP: LoadBalancerService with External scope
                          - IBMCloud: LoadBalancerService with External scope (or NodePort for UPI)
                          - None: HostNetwork
                          - KubeVirt: NodePortService
                          - OpenStack: LoadBalancerService with External scope and optional FloatingIP

                                  protocol specifies whether the IngressController expects incoming

                                  PROXY protocol.

                                  PROXY protocol can be used with load balancers that support it to
                                  communicate the source addresses of client connections when
                                  forwarding those connections to the IngressController.  Using PROXY
                                  protocol enables the IngressController to report those source
                                  addresses instead of reporting the load balancer's address in HTTP
                                  headers and logs.  Note that enabling PROXY protocol on the
                                  IngressController will cause connections to fail if you are not using
                                  a load balancer that uses PROXY protocol to forward connections to
                                  the IngressController.  See
                                  http://www.haproxy.org/download/2.2/doc/proxy-protocol.txt for
                                  information about PROXY protocol.

                                  to this IngressController, the load balancer should use this port for
                                  health checks. The load balancer can send HTTP probes on this port on a
                                  given node, with the path /healthz/ready to determine if the ingress
                                  controller is ready to receive traffic on the node. For proper operation
                                  the load balancer must not forward traffic to a node until the health

                                  not-ready. Probing every 5 to 10 seconds, with a 5-second timeout and with

                                          protocol specifies whether the load balancer uses PROXY protocol to forward connections to

                                          PROXY protocol can be used with load balancers that support it to

                                          forwarding those connections to the IngressController.  Using PROXY
                                          protocol enables the IngressController to report those source
                                          addresses instead of reporting the load balancer's address in HTTP
                                          headers and logs.  Note that enabling PROXY protocol on the
                                          IngressController will cause connections to fail if you are not using

                              Publishes the ingress controller using a Kubernetes LoadBalancer Service.

                              In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses container
                              networking. A LoadBalancer Service is created to publish the deployment.

                              See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer

                              If domain is set, a wildcard DNS record will be managed to point at the
                              LoadBalancer Service's external name. DNS records are managed only in DNS
                              zones defined by dns.config.openshift.io/cluster .spec.publicZone and
                              .spec.privateZone.

                              Wildcard DNS management is currently supported only on the AWS, Azure,
                              and GCP platforms.

                              * HostNetwork

                              Publishes the ingress controller on node ports where the ingress controller
                              is deployed.

                              In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses host
                              networking, bound to node ports 80 and 443. The user is responsible for
                              configuring an external load balancer to publish the ingress controller via
                              the node ports.

                              * Private

                              Does not publish the ingress controller.

                              In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses container
                              networking, and is not explicitly published. The user must manually publish
                              the ingress controller.

                              * NodePortService

                              Publishes the ingress controller using a Kubernetes NodePort Service.

                              In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses container
                              networking. A NodePort Service is created to publish the deployment. The
                              specific node ports are dynamically allocated by OpenShift; however, to
                              support static port allocations, user changes to the node port
                              field of the managed NodePort Service will preserved.

                  The maximum and minimum supported release versions are determined by the running Hypersfhit Operator.
                  Attempting to use an unsupported version will result in the HostedCluster being degraded and the validateReleaseImage condition being false.
                  Attempting to use a release with a skew against a NodePool release bigger than N-2 for the y-stream will result in leaving the NodePool in an unsupported state.
                  Changing this field will trigger a rollout of the control plane components.

                              If you disable audit logging and a support situation arises, you might need to enable audit logging
                              and reproduce the issue in order to troubleshoot properly.

                          matching the domainPattern/s and namespaceSelector/s that are specified in the policy.
                          Each requiredHSTSPolicy must have at least a domainPattern and a maxAge to validate a route HSTS Policy route
                          annotation, and affect route admission.

                          A candidate route is checked for HSTS Policies if it has the HSTS Policy route annotation:
                          "haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header"
                          E.g. haproxy.router.openshift.io/hsts_header: max-age=31536000;preload;includeSubDomains

                          - For each candidate route, if it matches a requiredHSTSPolicy domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector,
                          then the maxAge, preloadPolicy, and includeSubdomainsPolicy must be valid to be admitted.  Otherwise, the route
                          is rejected.
                          - The first match, by domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector, in the ordering of the RequiredHSTSPolicies
                          determines the route's admission status.
                          - If the candidate route doesn't match any requiredHSTSPolicy domainPattern and optional namespaceSelector,
                          then it may use any HSTS Policy annotation.

                          The HSTS policy configuration may be changed after routes have already been created. An update to a previously
                          admitted route may then fail if the updated route does not conform to the updated HSTS policy configuration.
                          However, changing the HSTS policy configuration will not cause a route that is already admitted to stop working.

                          Note that if there are no RequiredHSTSPolicies, any HSTS Policy annotation on the route is valid.

                                foo.com only matches foo.com, so to cover foo.com and everything under it, you must specify *both*.

                              used within this temporal window. The user will need to acquire a new
                              token to regain access once a token times out. Takes valid time
                              duration string such as "5m", "1.5h" or "2h45m". The minimum allowed

                              per client, then that value takes precedence. If the timeout value is
                              not specified and the client does not override the value, then tokens

                          The trustedCA field should only be consumed by a proxy validator. The

                          and writing the merged trust bundle to a ConfigMap named "trusted-ca-bundle"
                          in the "openshift-config-managed" namespace. Clients that expect to make
                          proxy connections must use the trusted-ca-bundle for all HTTPS requests to
                          the proxy, and may use the trusted-ca-bundle for non-proxy HTTPS requests as

                          defaultNodeSelector helps set the cluster-wide default node selector to
                          restrict pod placement to specific nodes. This is applied to the pods
                          created in all namespaces and creates an intersection with any existing
                          nodeSelectors already set on a pod, additionally constraining that pod's selector.
                          For example,
                          defaultNodeSelector: "type=user-node,region=east" would set nodeSelector
                          field in pod spec to "type=user-node,region=east" to all pods created
                          in all namespaces. Namespaces having project-wide node selectors won't be
                          impacted even if this field is set. This adds an annotation section to
                          the namespace.
                          For example, if a new namespace is created with
                          node-selector='type=user-node,region=east',
                          the annotation openshift.io/node-selector: type=user-node,region=east
                          gets added to the project. When the openshift.io/node-selector annotation
                          is set on the project the value is used in preference to the value we are setting
                          for defaultNodeSelector field.
                          For instance,
                          openshift.io/node-selector: "type=user-node,region=west" means
                          that the default of "type=user-node,region=east" set in defaultNodeSelector
                          would not be applied.

                          The endpoint publishing strategy is determined by the following precedence order:
                          1. User-specified endpointPublishingStrategy (highest priority) - if this field is set,
                             it takes precedence over all other configuration methods
                          2. Platform-specific defaults with annotation overrides - if no user strategy is set,
                             the platform type determines the default strategy, which can be further modified by:
                             - hypershift.openshift.io/private-ingress-controller annotation (sets PrivateStrategyType)
                             - hypershift.openshift.io/ingress-controller-load-balancer-scope annotation (sets LoadBalancerScope)
                          3. Generic LoadBalancer fallback - if the platform is not recognized, defaults to
                             LoadBalancerService with External scope

                          Platform-specific defaults when endpointPublishingStrategy is not set:
                          - AWS: LoadBalancerService with External scope (or NLB if configured)
                          - Azure, GCP: LoadBalancerService with External scope

                          - KubeVirt: NodePortService

                                  protocol specifies whether the IngressController expects incoming

                                  PROXY protocol.

                                  PROXY protocol can be used with load balancers that support it to
                                  communicate the source addresses of client connections when
                                  forwarding those connections to the IngressController.  Using PROXY
                                  protocol enables the IngressController to report those source
                                  addresses instead of reporting the load balancer's address in HTTP
                                  headers and logs.  Note that enabling PROXY protocol on the

                                  a load balancer that uses PROXY protocol to forward connections to

                                  statsPort is the port on the host where the stats from the router are
                                  published. The value should not coincide with the NodePort range of the
                                  cluster. If an external load balancer is configured to forward connections
                                  to this IngressController, the load balancer should use this port for
                                  health checks. The load balancer can send HTTP probes on this port on a
                                  given node, with the path /healthz/ready to determine if the ingress
                                  controller is ready to receive traffic on the node. For proper operation
                                  the load balancer must not forward traffic to a node until the health
                                  check reports ready. The load balancer should also stop forwarding requests
                                  within a maximum of 45 seconds after /healthz/ready starts reporting
                                  not-ready. Probing every 5 to 10 seconds, with a 5-second timeout and with
                                  a threshold of two successful or failed requests to become healthy or
                                  unhealthy respectively, are well-tested values. When the value is 0 or
                                  is not specified it defaults to 1936.

                                              The following restrictions apply:

                                              eipAllocations can only be used with external scope, not internal.
                                              An EIP can be allocated to only a single IngressController.
                                              The number of EIP allocations must match the number of subnets that are used for the load balancer.
                                              Each EIP allocation must be unique.
                                              A maximum of 10 EIP allocations are permitted.

                                          protocol specifies whether the load balancer uses PROXY protocol to forward connections to
                                          the IngressController. See "service.kubernetes.io/ibm-load-balancer-cloud-provider-enable-features:

                                          PROXY protocol can be used with load balancers that support it to
                                          communicate the source addresses of client connections when
                                          forwarding those connections to the IngressController.  Using PROXY
                                          protocol enables the IngressController to report those source
                                          addresses instead of reporting the load balancer's address in HTTP
                                          headers and logs.  Note that enabling PROXY protocol on the
                                          IngressController will cause connections to fail if you are not using

                                  PROXY protocol can be used with load balancers that support it to
                                  communicate the source addresses of client connections when
                                  forwarding those connections to the IngressController.  Using PROXY
                                  protocol enables the IngressController to report those source
                                  addresses instead of reporting the load balancer's address in HTTP
                                  headers and logs.  Note that enabling PROXY protocol on the
                                  IngressController will cause connections to fail if you are not using
                                  a load balancer that uses PROXY protocol to forward connections to

                              Publishes the ingress controller using a Kubernetes LoadBalancer Service.

                              In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses container
                              networking. A LoadBalancer Service is created to publish the deployment.

                              See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer

                              If domain is set, a wildcard DNS record will be managed to point at the
                              LoadBalancer Service's external name. DNS records are managed only in DNS
                              zones defined by dns.config.openshift.io/cluster .spec.publicZone and
                              .spec.privateZone.

                              Wildcard DNS management is currently supported only on the AWS, Azure,
                              and GCP platforms.

                              * HostNetwork

                              Publishes the ingress controller on node ports where the ingress controller
                              is deployed.

                              In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses host
                              networking, bound to node ports 80 and 443. The user is responsible for
                              configuring an external load balancer to publish the ingress controller via
                              the node ports.

                              * Private

                              Does not publish the ingress controller.

                              In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses container
                              networking, and is not explicitly published. The user must manually publish
                              the ingress controller.

                              Publishes the ingress controller using a Kubernetes NodePort Service.

                              In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses container
                              networking. A NodePort Service is created to publish the deployment. The
                              specific node ports are dynamically allocated by OpenShift; however, to

                              field of the managed NodePort Service will preserved.

                          OCP control plane cloud integrations, and is used by NodePool to resolve
                          the correct boot AMI for a given release.

                          resourceTags is a list of additional tags to apply to AWS resources created
                          for the cluster. See
                          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html for
                          information on tagging AWS resources. AWS supports a maximum of 50 tags per
                          resource. OpenShift reserves 25 tags for its use, leaving 25 tags available
                          for the user.
                          Changes to this field will be propagated in-place to AWS resources (VPC Endpoints, EC2 instances, initial EBS volumes and default/endpoint security groups).
                          These tags will be propagated to the infrastructure CR in the guest cluster, where other OCP operators might choose to honor this input to reconcile AWS resources created by them.
                          Please consult the official documentation for a list of all AWS resources that support in-place tag updates.
                          These take precedence over tags defined out of band (i.e., tags added manually or by other tools outside of HyperShift) in AWS in case of conflicts.

                          the *.apps domain of the management/infra hosting cluster
                          This makes the guest cluster's base domain a subdomain of the
                          hypershift infra/mgmt cluster's base domain.

                          Example:
                            Infra/Mgmt cluster's DNS
                              Base: example.com
                              Cluster: mgmt-cluster.example.com
                              Apps:    *.apps.mgmt-cluster.example.com
                            KubeVirt Guest cluster's DNS
                              Base: apps.mgmt-cluster.example.com
                              Cluster: guest.apps.mgmt-cluster.example.com

                  Version-skew rules and effects:
                    - The minor-version skew relative to the control-plane release must be <= N-2.
                      This is not currently enforced, but exceeding this limit is unsupported and
                      may lead to unpredictable behavior.
                    - If the specified release is higher than the HostedCluster's release, the
                      NodePool will be degraded and the ValidReleaseImage condition will be false.
                    - If the specified release is lower than the NodePool's current y-stream,
                      the NodePool will be degraded and the ValidReleaseImage condition will be false.
